# Unichars
Go-language library to check for problematic Unicode code points.

This is based on the Unicode code-point subsets specified in 
[draft-bray-unichars](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bray-unichars/), which has been approved by the IETF and will have an RFC number in the near future.

There are three named subsets:
- Unicode Scalars
- XML Characters
- Unicode Assignables

The exported function names are descriptive of what they do.
